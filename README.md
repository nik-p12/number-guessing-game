# Number Guessing Game

The Number Guessing Game is a simple Python game built using Tkinter for the graphical user interface. The game generates a random number, and the player has to guess the correct number within a limited number of attempts. Visual indicators (hearts) are used to represent the remaining attempts, and feedback messages are displayed in pop-ups.

## How to Reset the Score Frame

To reset the score frame after each game, modify the init_game function by clearing and restoring the heart icons:
```python
 def reset_score_frame():
     global labels
     for label in labels:
         label.destroy()
     labels.clear()
     for _ in range(5):
         label = Label(frame, image=logo)
         label.pack(side='right')
         labels.append(label)
```
Then, call this function inside init_game():
```python
def init_game():
     global trial, nb, labels
     trial = 5 
     nb = random.randint(1, 100)
     reset_score_frame()
```
